# ProjectEvaluationSlotBooking

The aim of the project is to develop a system to ease the booking of slots in an online manner. 
The students need a login and they can request their evaluation committee members about the available time slots of a date or a period. 
Teachers are able to login and mark their free/available time slot in the calendar after getting a request from the student. 
Based on the response from teachers(marking in the calendar) the system needs to match all those members' matching time and 
indicate it to the student with a slot in which every member is free
